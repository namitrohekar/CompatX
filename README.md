# CompatX - Modern E-Commerce Platform

A full-stack e-commerce application built with Spring Boot and React, featuring secure authentication, payment integration, and comprehensive order management.

## 🎯 Project Overview

CompatX is a feature-rich online shopping platform that I developed to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers while offering powerful management tools for administrators. The application handles everything from product browsing to secure checkout, with support for multiple payment gateways and real-time order tracking.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modern three-tier architecture with clear separation of concerns:

   ```

2. **Configure Database**
   
   Create a MySQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE compatx_db;
   ```

   Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/compatx_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

3. **Configure Email Service**
   
   Add your email configuration in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
   spring.mail.port=587
   spring.mail.username=your_email@gmail.com
   spring.mail.password=your_app_password
   ```

4. **Configure Payment Gateways**
   
   Add your API keys:
   ```properties
   stripe.api.key=your_stripe_secret_key
   razorpay.key.id=your_razorpay_key_id
   razorpay.key.secret=your_razorpay_secret
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd ../compatX-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure API endpoint**
   
   Update the API base URL in `src/lib/axiosClient.js` if needed (default is `http://localhost:8080`)

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
